== Overview and Goals


In this, opening, module, we will explore the lab goals, our environment and introduce the Containerized Ansible Automation Platform and get ready to install the Containerized version of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2, typically referred to as AAP2 from now on for brevity.

== Lab Goals

* Understand that this Lab is built around a TechPreview
* Understand the overall architecture and technologies of Ansible  
* Become familiar with different deployment options
* Install the Containerized version of AAP2
** Automation Hub
** Event Driven Automation
** Postgres
* Configure AAP2 Containerized via the Postinstall option
* Explore the AAP2 Containerized environment
** Storage 
** Logs
** Troubleshooting

== Tech Preview

The Containerized Ansible Automation Platform and its Installer are *currently* in Tech Preview, which Red Hat defines link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[here].

[quote,Opening paragraph of Red Hat's Tech Preview Technology Preview Features - Scope of Support]
____
_Technology Preview features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. However, these features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Level Agreements, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. As Red Hat considers making future iterations of Technology Preview features generally available, we will attempt to resolve any issues that customers experience when using these features._
____

As a result, some features are not finalized or are missing. For example, the latest Preview Installer does *not* include direct support for TLS and we will use http in our lab. (The enterprising, and fast, user can of course add a reverse proxy with TLS termination.)

== Current Requirements

Containerized AAP2 requires Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 or later.

[#topology]
== Lab Topology

The lab topology is quite simple

image::topology.png[Lab Topology,align="center",width="100%"]

[cols="15%,15%,15%,55%"]
|===
|Server |Operating System|External Interface|Role

|bastion
|RHEL 9.3
|Yes
|DevOps Server - you will primarily work from here

|aap2
|RHEL 9.3
|Yes
|Primary AAP2 Platform for Controller, Hub, EDA

|aap2-backend
|RHEL 9.3
|No
|Postgres database - you will install this 

|app-frontend
|RHEL 9.3
|Yes
|Simple frontend for test application

|app-frontend
|RHEL 9.3
|No
|Simple backend for test application

|===

The terminals to your right are logged in via `ssh` to the bastion as the `devops` user. You can directly `ssh` to any of the hosts in your environment. You will run the installer from `bastion` but your Contaierized AAP2 will deploy to `aap2` and your Postgres database to `aap2-database`

NOTE: All instances are running RHEL 9.3 and are sized appropriately for the lab.

== Resources and Credentials 

At any point in the labs, you can find the Resources and Credentials are all gathered in the this document, at the bottom of the navigation menu top left link:Resources-and-Credentials.html[Resources].
